        </h3>
        <p class="problem-card__description">
          Over 30% of doctors' consultation time is spent trying to navigate
          through incomplete or inconsistent patient records‚Äîtime that should
          instead go into diagnosis and treatment.

        <p class="problem-card__description">
          In accidents and unforeseen situations, people are unsure of the right
          steps to take. Ambulance bookings are delayed due to repeated
          information-sharing, and in critical times of blood need, patients
          rely only on family circles‚Äîwasting precious minutes.

            The government initiative like ABHA and private companies ask

            During emergencies, people end up Googling symptoms, dialing 112, or
            relying on guesswork‚Äîlosing precious time without finding real
